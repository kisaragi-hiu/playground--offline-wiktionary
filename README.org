Do this on jawiktionary first, which is a lot smaller.

There is Kiwix. For offline Wikipedia, that is the best. For dictionary lookup, it has the benefit of not needing a connection, but when online it isn't faster than seaching online.

I want an offline wiktionary client that can allow rapid lookup, eg. while translating, even with low network speeds.

Wiktionary is extremely complex, which is understandable as a world wide wiki. This project will not be able to show each page perfectly, but the rendering should hopefully be good enough to be useful.
